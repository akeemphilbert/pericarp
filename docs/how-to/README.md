# How-to Guides

These problem-oriented guides provide practical solutions for specific implementation challenges you might face when using Pericarp.

## Quick Solutions

### Common Tasks
- [Implementing Custom Aggregates](custom-aggregates.md) - Create domain aggregates with business logic
- [Creating Custom Middleware](middleware.md) - Add cross-cutting concerns to handlers

- [Error Handling Patterns](error-handling.md) - Handle errors gracefully across layers

### Performance & Optimization
- [Performance Optimization](performance.md) - Optimize your application for production
- [Caching Strategies](caching.md) - Implement effective caching patterns
- [Batch Processing](batch-processing.md) - Handle large volumes of data efficiently

### Testing
- [Testing Strategies](testing-strategies.md) - Comprehensive testing approaches
- [BDD with Cucumber](bdd-testing.md) - Behavior-driven development
- [Integration Testing](integration-testing.md) - Test with real dependencies
- [Performance Testing](performance-testing.md) - Load and stress testing

### Advanced Patterns
- [Saga Pattern](sagas.md) - Manage distributed transactions
- [Event Handlers](event-handlers.md) - Process domain events effectively
- [Read Models](read-models.md) - Optimize queries with projections
- [Multi-tenant Applications](multi-tenancy.md) - Support multiple tenants

### Deployment & Operations
- [Configuration Management](configuration.md) - Manage application configuration
- [Monitoring & Observability](monitoring.md) - Monitor your application in production
- [Docker Deployment](docker.md) - Containerize your application
- [Database Migrations](migrations.md) - Manage database schema changes

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide follows this structure:

1. **Problem** - What specific problem does this solve?
2. **Solution** - Step-by-step implementation
3. **Code Examples** - Complete, working code
4. **Alternatives** - Other approaches you might consider
5. **Related** - Links to related guides and concepts
