# Tutorial: Learning Pericarp

Welcome to the Pericarp tutorial series! This learning-oriented guide will take you from zero to building a complete application using Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing patterns.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial series, you'll understand:

- How to structure applications using DDD layered architecture
- How to implement CQRS with command and query handlers
- How to use Event Sourcing for data persistence
- How to write comprehensive tests for your application
- How to configure and deploy your application

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Go programming
- Familiarity with SQL databases (helpful but not required)
- Text editor or IDE of your choice

## Tutorial Path

### 1. [Getting Started](getting-started.md) ⏱️ 15 minutes
Set up your development environment and create your first Pericarp application.

**What you'll build:** A minimal "Hello World" application that demonstrates the basic structure.

### 2. [Building a User Management System](user-management.md) ⏱️ 45 minutes
Build a complete user management system with commands, queries, and events.

**What you'll build:** A user management API with create, update, and query operations.

### 3. [Adding Event Sourcing](event-sourcing.md) ⏱️ 30 minutes
Implement event sourcing to persist and replay domain events.

**What you'll build:** Event-sourced user aggregate with event store persistence.

### 4. [Testing Your Application](testing.md) ⏱️ 30 minutes
Write comprehensive tests including unit tests, integration tests, and BDD scenarios.

**What you'll build:** Complete test suite with high coverage and realistic scenarios.
