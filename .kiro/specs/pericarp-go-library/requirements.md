# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pericarp is a Go library that implements common software architectural concepts including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Event Sourcing with Persist-then-Dispatch pattern. The library provides a foundation for building server applications faster by offering well-structured layers and interfaces that adhere to DDD principles while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Go developer, I want a library that implements DDD layered architecture, so that I can build server applications with clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is imported THEN it SHALL provide distinct Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers
2. WHEN using the Domain layer THEN it SHALL contain only pure Go code with no infrastructure imports
3. WHEN using the Application layer THEN it SHALL provide command handlers, query handlers, and event handlers (projectors/sagas)
4. WHEN using the Infrastructure layer THEN it SHALL provide Event Store, Event Dispatcher, repository implementations, DTOs, and platform utilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CQRS and Event Sourcing capabilities, so that I can implement scalable applications with clear command/query separation and event-driven architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing CQRS THEN the library SHALL provide separate interfaces for command and query handling
2. WHEN using Event Sourcing THEN the library SHALL support persisting events before dispatching them (Persist-then-Dispatch)
3. WHEN events are persisted THEN the system SHALL return an array of envelopes containing the events
4. WHEN events are dispatched THEN they SHALL be processed by appropriate event handlers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want core interfaces for event handling, so that I can implement event-driven architecture with consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library THEN it SHALL provide an Event interface for domain events
2. WHEN storing events THEN it SHALL provide an EventStore interface for persistence
3. WHEN dispatching events THEN it SHALL provide an EventDispatcher interface
4. WHEN managing transactions THEN it SHALL provide a Unit of Work interface for persisting events
5. WHEN wrapping events THEN it SHALL provide an Envelope interface to contain event metadata

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible infrastructure implementations, so that I can choose appropriate technologies for my specific use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN it SHALL use Viper for command line configuration
2. WHEN setting up dependency injection THEN it SHALL use Fx for application container management
3. WHEN persisting events THEN it SHALL use GORM as the Event Store implementation to support multiple databases
4. WHEN dispatching events THEN it SHALL use Watermill with Go channel publishers for internal events
5. WHEN using external messaging THEN it SHALL support Watermill pubsub for external event dispatching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database flexibility, so that I can run my application on different database systems based on my deployment requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL support SQLite database
2. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL support PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN switching databases THEN the application SHALL work without code changes to domain logic
4. WHEN configuring database THEN it SHALL be done through infrastructure layer only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working demonstration, so that I can understand how to use the library and verify it works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is complete THEN it SHALL include a basic demo application
2. WHEN running the demo THEN it SHALL demonstrate CQRS command and query handling
3. WHEN running the demo THEN it SHALL demonstrate Event Sourcing with event persistence and dispatch
4. WHEN running the demo THEN it SHALL work with both SQLite and PostgreSQL configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities, so that I can ensure the library works correctly and meets business requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing acceptance tests THEN the system SHALL use Cucumber for BDD testing
2. WHEN writing Gherkin scenarios THEN they SHALL follow best practices from https://automationpanda.com/2017/01/30/bdd-101-writing-good-gherkin/
3. WHEN creating test scenarios THEN they SHALL focus on business behavior rather than implementation details
4. WHEN generating mocks THEN the system SHALL use moq for interface mocking
5. WHEN writing unit tests THEN they SHALL not require external testing frameworks like testify

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code, so that the library is easy to understand, extend, and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing domain logic THEN it SHALL remain pure Go with no external dependencies
2. WHEN adding external dependencies THEN they SHALL be minimized and isolated to infrastructure layer
3. WHEN serializing data THEN it SHALL prefer JSON over Gob encoding
4. WHEN processing events THEN it SHALL avoid reflection in hot code paths for performance
5. WHEN organizing code THEN it SHALL follow clean architecture principles

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standard Go project structure, so that the library follows Go community conventions and is easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN it SHALL follow standard Go project layout conventions
2. WHEN structuring packages THEN it SHALL clearly separate domain, application, and infrastructure concerns
3. WHEN naming packages THEN it SHALL use clear, descriptive names that reflect their purpose
4. WHEN organizing files THEN it SHALL group related functionality logically within packages
5. WHEN writing BDD scenarios THEN they SHALL be organized in feature files with clear business language
