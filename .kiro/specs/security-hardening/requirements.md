# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses security hardening for the Pericarp library and demo application. The goal is to identify and remediate common security vulnerabilities, implement security best practices, and ensure the library serves as a secure foundation for production applications. This includes addressing issues like CWE-703 (Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions), input validation, secure configuration management, and other security concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want all system operations to be properly error-checked, so that I can detect and handle failures that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling system functions that return errors THEN the system SHALL check all returned errors
2. WHEN system operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors according to their security impact
3. WHEN critical operations fail THEN the system SHALL fail securely rather than continue with invalid state
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security-relevant failures appropriately
5. WHEN handling CWE-703 violations THEN all unchecked error returns SHALL be identified and fixed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want input validation and sanitization throughout the application, so that I can prevent injection attacks and data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accepting user input THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs against expected formats
2. WHEN processing command-line arguments THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all parameters
3. WHEN handling file paths THEN the system SHALL prevent path traversal attacks
4. WHEN processing configuration data THEN the system SHALL validate configuration values
5. WHEN accepting database inputs THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want secure configuration and secrets management, so that sensitive information is protected and configuration is tamper-resistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling configuration files THEN the system SHALL validate file permissions and ownership
2. WHEN processing environment variables THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize values
3. WHEN dealing with sensitive data THEN the system SHALL avoid logging secrets or credentials
4. WHEN configuration fails THEN the system SHALL fail securely without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN using default configurations THEN they SHALL follow security best practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure logging and error handling, so that security events are properly tracked without exposing sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL not expose sensitive data in log messages
2. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
3. WHEN handling authentication failures THEN the system SHALL log security-relevant events
4. WHEN errors contain user data THEN the system SHALL sanitize before logging
5. WHEN verbose logging is enabled THEN it SHALL not expose credentials or secrets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to follow secure coding practices, so that applications built with Pericarp are secure by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing database operations THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries
2. WHEN handling concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions
3. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL properly close and cleanup resources
4. WHEN implementing authentication THEN the system SHALL use secure comparison functions
5. WHEN generating IDs THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want comprehensive security testing, so that I can verify the library meets security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running security tests THEN the system SHALL include tests for common vulnerabilities
2. WHEN testing input validation THEN the system SHALL test boundary conditions and malicious inputs
3. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL verify secure failure modes
4. WHEN testing configuration THEN the system SHALL verify secure defaults
5. WHEN performing static analysis THEN the system SHALL pass security-focused linting tools

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility maintained during security improvements, so that existing applications continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security improvements are implemented THEN existing APIs SHALL remain compatible
2. WHEN configuration is hardened THEN existing valid configurations SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN error handling is improved THEN the user experience SHALL be enhanced, not broken
4. WHEN security features are added THEN they SHALL be opt-in where possible to maintain compatibility
