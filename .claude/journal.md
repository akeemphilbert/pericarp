# Pericarp Journal

Append-only log of major changes to Pericarp. Each entry records what changed,
why, and any key design decisions. Claude Code reads this at the start of major
tasks to maintain context across sessions. Entries are never edited or removed.

### 2026-03-17: Multi-tenant auth foundations

- Added `pkg/auth` package with `Identity`, context helpers (`AgentFromCtx`, `ContextWithAgent`)
- Added JWT-based authentication service with RSA key support
- Added invite system (`InviteService`, `InviteTokenService`) for account onboarding
- Added `ResourceOwnership` helpers for tenant-scoped resource creation and access verification
- Added account switching support via session management
- **Why:** Building toward a multi-tenant IAM layer where agents belong to accounts, resources are tenant-scoped, and authentication flows support invite-based onboarding

### 2026-03-21: BigQuery EventStore implementation

- Added `BigQueryEventStore` in `pkg/eventsourcing/infrastructure/bigquery_store.go` — 5th EventStore implementation
- Uses BigQuery DML (INSERT via `client.Query()`) for strong read-after-write consistency
- Optimistic concurrency via BigQuery scripting blocks (DECLARE + IF/ELSE) — DML table-level locks serialize concurrent writes
- Payload/metadata stored as JSON STRING columns (schemaless, like GORM's JSONB approach)
- `GetEventByID` performs full table scan since `id` is not in the clustering key — documented trade-off
- Integration tests use `ghcr.io/goccy/bigquery-emulator` via testcontainers; skip gracefully without Docker
- Added BigQuery variants to shared table-driven tests in `eventstore_test.go` and `eventstore_range_test.go`
- **Why:** BigQuery is append-optimized and enables powerful analytics over event streams — natural fit for event sourcing at scale

### 2026-04-04: Transaction ID for unit of work correlation

- Added `TransactionID` field to `EventEnvelope[T]` — a KSUID string that correlates all events committed in the same unit of work
- `SimpleUnitOfWork.Commit()` generates a single transaction ID and stamps it on every event before persisting
- Updated `ToAnyEnvelope` to copy the `TransactionID` field
- Field is `omitempty` in JSON so existing events without a transaction ID remain backward-compatible
- Added tests: same-commit events share a transaction ID, different commits get different IDs, dispatched events carry the transaction ID
- **Why:** Enables correlating events across multiple aggregates that were committed together, useful for auditing, debugging, and cross-aggregate consistency tracking

### 2026-04-25: Abstract resource projections

- Added `pkg/projection/` package with type hierarchy registry and polymorphic repository
- `Registry` tracks abstract/concrete resource types with single-level parent-child relationships
- `PolymorphicRepository[T]` provides CRUD + paginated list on a shared projection table with a `resource_type` discriminator column
- Concrete subtypes (e.g., Loan, DepositAccount) share the abstract parent's table; type-specific fields stored in a JSONB `data` column
- `FindAllByParentType()` resolves all concrete subtypes via the registry, enabling unified lists across a class hierarchy
- Reuses existing `JSONB` type from `pkg/eventsourcing/infrastructure` and follows the cursor-based pagination pattern from `pkg/auth`
- **Why:** Enables abstract resource types whose concrete subclasses share a single projection table, so front-end lists can show all subtypes together while the discriminator preserves type identity
